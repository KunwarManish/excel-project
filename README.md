# excel-dashboard-project

This project is based on Excel Dashboard Design, in which I use sample sales data to generate pivot tables and pivot charts. After that, I use various formatting approaches and strategies to make the visualizations more understandable and interactive. In the end, I construct two dashboards, one for revenue and another for profit, and add slicers and timelines to each of them.
